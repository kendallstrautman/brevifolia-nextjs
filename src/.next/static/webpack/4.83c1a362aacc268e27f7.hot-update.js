All three species are long-lived and highly resilient to harsh weather and bad soils. One of the three species, _Pinus longaeva_, is among the longest-lived life forms on Earth. The oldest _Pinus longaeva_ is more than 5,000 years old,[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-oldest-1) making it the oldest known individual of any species.\n\n![](static/scott-webb-qauaqihMwpc-unsplash.jpg)\n\nDespite their potential age and low reproductive rate, bristlecone pines, particularly _Pinus longaeva_, are usually a [first-succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_succession \"Primary succession\") species, tending to occupy new open ground.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2) They generally compete poorly in less-than-harsh environments, making them hard to cultivate.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2) In gardens, they succumb quickly to root rot.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-3) They do very well, however, where most other plants cannot even grow, such as in rocky [dolomitic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolomite_(mineral)> \"Dolomite (mineral)\") soils in areas with virtually no rainfall.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-FEIS-2)\n\nBristlecone pines grow in scattered [subalpine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalpine \"Subalpine\") groves at high altitude in arid regions of the [Western United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_United_States \"Western United States\"). Bristlecones, along with all related species in class Pinopsida, are [cone-bearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer_cone \"Conifer cone\") [seed plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_plant \"Seed plant\") commonly known as [conifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifer \"Conifer\"); the name comes from the prickles on the female cones.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine#cite_note-ARKive-4)\n");
